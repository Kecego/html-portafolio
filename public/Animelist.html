<p>I don't know how to describe this beautiful piece of art, The Script, the caracters, what the try to show you is something magical,
    sometime a lit bit "ecchi" but that's just part of the fan service.</p>
<h3>One Piece</h3>

<p>I remember, i used to say i will never watch One Piece, that just too many charpters, i can spend my time with another anime, but one 
    day, one of my biggest friends show me one chapter, and it was amazing, for those time i started to read manga, and i was on summer 
    vacations, so it took me like 3 weeks to read 850 chapters, was a crazyness but i didn't regret.</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>

<p>Nothing to say, Naruto is Naruto, yeah, we all know that's too much "crap cap" but, gosh! We all were happy when we saw Naruto became
    Hokage.</p>
